# The Radio class is the master class of the program. It initializes an
# internally stored Parser and uses it to read valid, sanitized Messages from
# the input stream. It is responsible only for handling high-level protocol
# errors, and expects that all received Messages will be correctly formatted
# and exist, or otherwise be marked as INVALID.

    # # ATTEMPT_CONNECT is the main method. Reads messages one at a time and parses major message sections based on the received
    # # message. Reading a message of a particular type kicks off parsing further for that type of message.
    # # This method also swallows all exceptions when in production to ensure no raw errors ever make it back to the client.
